yt is an open-source, permissively-licensed python package for analyzing and
visualizing volumetric data.

yt supports structured, variable-resolution meshes, unstructured meshes, and
discrete or sampled data such as particles. Focused on driving
physically-meaningful inquiry, yt has been applied in domains such as
astrophysics, seismology, nuclear engineering, molecular dynamics, and
oceanography. Composed of a friendly community of users and developers, we want
to make it easy to use and develop - we'd love it if you got involved!

We've written a [method
paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....9T) you may be interested
in; if you use yt in the preparation of a publication, please consider citing
it.

## Installation

If you're using conda with [conda-forge](http://conda-forge.github.io/), you
can install the most recent stable version by running:

```
conda install -c conda-forge yt
```

or by doing:

```
pip install yt
```

If you want the latest nightly build, you can manually install from our
repository:

```
conda install -c http://use.yt/with_conda yt
```

To get set up with a development version, you can clone this repository and
install like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/yt-project/yt yt-git
cd yt-git
python setup.py develop
```

To set up yt in a virtualenv (and there are [many good
reasons](https://packaging.python.org/installing/#creating-virtual-environments)
to do so!) you can follow this prescription:

```
# Assuming you have cd'd into yt-git
# It is conventional to create virtualenvs at ~/.virtualenv/
$ mkdir -p ~/.virtualenv
# Assuming your version of Python 3 is 3.4 or higher,
# create a virtualenv named yt
$ python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenv/yt
# Activate it
$ source ~/.virtualenv/yt/bin/activate
# Make sure you run the latest version of pip
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install -e .
# Output installed packages
$ pip freeze
```

## Getting Started

yt is designed to provide meaningful analysis of data.  We have some Quickstart
example notebooks in the repository:

 * [Introduction](doc/source/quickstart/1\)_Introduction.ipynb)
 * [Data Inspection](doc/source/quickstart/2\)_Data_Inspection.ipynb)
 * [Simple Visualization](doc/source/quickstart/3\)_Simple_Visualization.ipynb)
 * [Data Objects and Time Series](doc/source/quickstart/4\)_Data_Objects_and_Time_Series.ipynb)
 * [Derived Fields and Profiles](doc/source/quickstart/5\)_Derived_Fields_and_Profiles.ipynb)
 * [Volume Rendering](doc/source/quickstart/6\)_Volume_Rendering.ipynb)

If you'd like to try these online, you can visit our [yt Hub](https://hub.yt/)
and run a notebook next to some of our example data.

## Contributing

We love contributions!  yt is open source, built on open source, and we'd love
to have you hang out in our community.

We have developed some [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.rst) for contributing to yt.

## Resources

We have some community and documentation resources available.

 * Our latest documentation is always at http://yt-project.org/docs/dev/ and it
   includes recipes, tutorials, and API documentation
 * The [discussion mailing
   list](http://lists.spacepope.org/listinfo.cgi/yt-users-spacepope.org/)
   should be your first stop for general questions
 * The [development mailing
   list](http://lists.spacepope.org/listinfo.cgi/yt-dev-spacepope.org/) is
   better suited for more development issues
 * You can also join us on Slack at yt-project.slack.com ([request an
   invite](http://yt-project.org/slack.html))
